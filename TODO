# TODOs are not inorder but are randomly noted 
#   -> prorities may be assigned
#   -> categories are not strictly assigned but at first glimpse
#
# (features)
# - Tri-State Button Animation (may be more complex and may be dropped due to that)
# - Game Modes need a intro menu
#       - intro menu may be not game mode specific
#       - intro as popup directly after game mode start
# - more proper balanced game modes
#       - some are noted at whiteboard but need to be evaluated
#       - AND: others are need to be made
#       - ideas:
#           - labyrinth game mode: navigate a symbol until bottom and if success level up else game over...
#           - flappy bird mode: similar to labyrinth but with gates similar to flappy bird
# - Audio-Support
#       - background music
#       - on stone 2 board commit sound
#       - on row/word clear sound
# - animations:
#       - bomb animation
# - multiplayer? coop vs pubg
#       - possible P2P connection via WebRTC
#          https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/WebRTC_data_channels
#       - conceptual sketch:
#           player sets up profile (local) -> app generates a uid and shares with server or gets the uid from server
#           if player wants to play multiplayer it connects with its unique id and the server marks the user as online
#           player is able to search for other players by name
#           if player chose other player -> webrtc channel open
# - supporting story
# - ios support
# - highscore player name entry
#       #ifdef __ANDROID__
#       SDL_StartTextInput();
#       #endif /* __ANDROID__ */
# - show pogress until next level and current level
# - bonus points for double / triple / quad / etc.
#       highlight bonus with animation
# - achievements per game mode;
#   for classic:
#       - get two words in a row -> up to 5 words
#       - get 100k points -> up to 1mio
#       - reach level 12
#
# (design)
# - Logo Design and Naming
# - get an ui design review
# - ui redesign of player statistics and hint/letter preview
#
# (architecture bugs)
# - Drawing:
#       - message box to not use hard coded images and positions/dimensions
#       - do not use hard coded absolute pixel values which depend on SDL_WIDHT=540/SDL_HEIGHT=960 but relative values
#       - add word wrap on text boxes instead of char wrap
#       - support non 16:9 devices
# - Support Non-Ascii characters in Translations
#       - use ttf for text font -> reduced complexity for asset storage
# - Settings/Storage Architectures seems pretty weird
#       - review or documentation!
#
# (others)
# - android:
#       - (config management) release build for apk incl. signed certificates
#       - (business) eval income model: either ad based vs by app store payment vs freemium
# - version tracking
# - git optimization: store assets somewhere else?
#       - e.g. on the deadlock server within an asset pack and refer within git to a specific sha/version/whatever
#       - remove bmp assets and create script to generate assets from xcf on build 
#           - SDL2_image has xcf reading capabilities
#           - other libs
# - font lizenzen klaeren
