# (features)
# - Highscores shall be updated:
#       - function hook available but update strategy not quite clear
#       - ideas:
#           - EITHER: store highscores per game mode (e.g. first 5 of each mode)
#           - OR: store highscores overall (e.g. first 15 of all modes)
# - Tri-State Button Animation (may be more complex and may be dropped due to that)
# - Game Modes need a intro menu
#       - intro menu may be not game mode specific
# - more proper balanced game modes
#       - some are noted at whiteboard but need to be evaluated
#       - AND: others are need to be made
