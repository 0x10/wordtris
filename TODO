# TODOs are not inorder but are randomly noted 
#   -> prorities may be assigned
#   -> categories are not strictly assigned but at first glimpse
#
# (features)
# - Tri-State Button Animation (may be more complex and may be dropped due to that)
# - Game Modes need a intro menu
#       - intro menu may be not game mode specific
# - more proper balanced game modes
#       - some are noted at whiteboard but need to be evaluated
#       - AND: others are need to be made
# - Audio-Support
#       - background music
#       - on stone 2 board commit sound
#       - on row/word clear sound
# - animations:
#       - bomb animation
# - multiplayer? coop vs pubg
# - supporting story
# - ios support
# - option: supporting (grid-)guidelines
#       - setting is evaluated in game ctr and draws as overlay to wtBoard and wtActive
# - option: promote the next letter if configured
#       - new menu type (checkbox) needed (shares with supporting grid lines)
#           - maybe create two new types: WtLabel and WtCheckBox/WtBoolSlider
#           - a single type widget would be a WtCheckBoxButton: fullsize button with checkbox at end of label and two states
#       - setting is evaluated in game mode
#       - game modes supporting this feature need to precalc the next letter on each get next
#       - ui redesign needed for grid view
#           - scores does not need a label and can shrink in size to show next letter between pause and score
#
#
# (design)
# - Logo Design and Naming
# - get an ui design review
#
#
# (architecture bugs)
# - Drawing:
#       - message box to not use hard coded images and positions/dimensions
#       - do not use hard coded absolute pixel values which depend on SDL_WIDHT=540/SDL_HEIGHT=960 but relative values
#       - add word wrap on text boxes instead of char wrap
#       - support non 16:9 devices
# - Support Non-Ascii characters in Translations
# - Settings/Storage Architectures seems pretty weird
#       - review or documentation!
# - split up wt_types
# - organize files in folders 
#
# (others)
# - android:
#       - (config management) release build for apk incl. signed certificates
#       - (business) eval income model: either ad based vs by app store payment vs freemium
# - version tracking
