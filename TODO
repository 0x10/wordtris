# TODOs are not inorder but are randomly noted 
#   -> prorities may be assigned
#   -> categories are not strictly assigned but at first glimpse
#
# (road to release) - see below for details
#   - android certificate & release build
#   - [PROGRESS] tutorial or game mode specific intro section
#       -> proper text and maybe images needed
#   - [STOPPED] utf8 / iso8859-1
#           => internal type from char to utf8_char
#           -> STOPPED by decision; general ui texts are utf8 but grid alphabet remains ascii for first version
#   - logo
#
#
# (features)
# - Game Modes intro menu
#       - persistence of "hide next time" and reappearable
# - more proper balanced game modes
#       - ideas:
#           - labyrinth game mode: navigate a symbol until bottom and if success level up else game over...
#           - flappy bird mode: similar to labyrinth but with gates similar to flappy bird
# - animations:
#       - bomb animation
# - multiplayer? coop vs pubg
#       - possible P2P connection via WebRTC
#          https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/WebRTC_data_channels
#       - conceptual sketch:
#           player sets up profile (local) -> app generates a uid and shares with server or gets the uid from server
#           if player wants to play multiplayer it connects with its unique id and the server marks the user as online
#           player is able to search for other players by name
#           if player chose other player -> webrtc channel open
# - supporting story
# - ios support
# - highscore player name entry
#       #ifdef __ANDROID__
#       SDL_StartTextInput();
#       #endif /* __ANDROID__ */
# - bonus points for double / triple / quad / etc.
#       highlight bonus with animation
# - achievements per game mode;
#   for classic:
#       - get two words in a row -> up to 5 words
#       - get 100k points -> up to 1mio
#       - reach level 12
# - container for game mode specific settings like "show tutorial"
# - non-modal animations like score info overlay on word solved during continued gaming
#
#
# (design)
# - Logo Design
#
# (architecture bugs)
# - Drawing:
#       - redraw only if needed in menu
#       - support non 16:9 devices:
#           - issue may be resolved to overscan hidden feature 
#           - decide wether to modify it locally to have it fixed at the top
#               see patch here: https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/rev/8a29b371e2db
#           - proper solution "sdl"-like would be to render to texture instead of renderer directly
#             with fixed size and then position / background-overscan according to real screen size
#           - for aspect ratios like 4:3 another screen layout may be a solution
#
# (others)
# - android:
#       - (config management) release build for apk incl. signed certificates
# - version tracking
# - git optimization: store assets somewhere else?
#       - e.g. on the deadlock server within an asset pack and refer within git to a specific sha/version/whatever
#       - remove bmp assets and create script to generate assets from xcf on build 
#           - SDL2_image has xcf reading capabilities
#           - other libs
