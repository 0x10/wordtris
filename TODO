# Update 22.03.19
# ===============
# - Highscores shall be updated:
#       - function hook available but update strategy not quite clear
#       - ideas:
#           - EITHER: store highscores per game mode (e.g. first 5 of each mode)
#           - OR: store highscores overall (e.g. first 15 of all modes)
# - Tri-State Button Animation (may be more complex and may be dropped due to that)
# - Change Game Mode Button with proper "Button" like display; currently it feels more like a label than a button
# - Logo Design and Naming
# - Game Modes need a help and intro menu
#       - intro menu may be not game mode specific
# - SDL Drawing:
#       - message box to not use hard coded images and positions/dimensions
#       - reduction of api functions for more basic handling (draw text vs draw message vs draw hint)
#       - high level drawing functions like draw_player_stat shall be implemented in wt_drawing.h using basic policy functions and not in wt_sdl_drawing directly
# - SDL Input:
#       - Touch motion detection for swiping
# - UI Themes (esp. a dark theme) and a theme switcher
# - release build for apk incl. signed certificates
# - more proper balanced game modes
#       - some are noted at whiteboard but need to be evaluated
#       - AND: others are need to be made
# - android:
#       - eval income model: either ad based or by app store payment
# - get an ui design review
# - get rid of some early made singletons like WtPlayer, WtActive, WtBoard in game_ctr.h 
#       - they should be child members of wt_game_ctr
# - WtInput Architecture not consistent:
#       - Buttons are directly evaluated by observer-call to key-specific function ('a' -> notify_left for sdl e.g.) but touch areas are evaluated at listener function in general eval button
#       - ideas:
#           - EITHER: instead of button id use a wt_control enum
#           - OR: drop wt_control enum and eval keypress at listener too
#       - get rid of button_id in users class like game_ctr (maybe) or menu_ctr (must be) but hide this within parent class which wraps id to notify_left/_xxx function
#           - more like all common gui framework: onClicked()
#
