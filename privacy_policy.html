Christian Kranz built the Squabbel app as a Freemium app.<br/>
<br/>
This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.<br/>
<br/>
Information Collection and Use<br/>
<br/>
For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.<br/>
<br/>
The app does not use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.<br/>
<br/>
Score Data<br/>
<br/>
I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of finishing a game in the app with a non-zero score I collect this data - called Score Data - on your phone. This Score Data does only include the score achieved during gaming.<br/>
<br/>
Childrenâ€™s Privacy<br/>
<br/>
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.<br/>
<br/>

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.<br/>
