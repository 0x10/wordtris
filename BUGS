# (1, active) wordtris mode: if a word is found in a column, the whole column is cleared
# (2, active with (1)) wordtris mode: if a word is found in a row different to the top row, the row above is cleared too
# (5) texture magic crash happend once at android while guess the word game mode
# (7) letter drop sometimes drops the next letter too
#       - fix: no consecutive drop; each letter needs a distinct drop-region release and re-enter gesture to active the drop
# (8)
